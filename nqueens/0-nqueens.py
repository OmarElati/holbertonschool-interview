Description: The N queens puzzle is a classic problem in chess where N queens
must be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other
This program aims to solve the N queens problem.
Usage: nqueens N:
       If the program is called with an incorrect number
       of arguments, it prints "Usage: nqueens N" followed
       by a new line and exits with a status of 1.
where N must be an integer greater than or equal to 4:
       If N is not an integer, it prints "N must be a number"
       followed by a new line and exits with a status of 1.
       If N is smaller than 4, it prints "N must be at least 4
       " followed by a new line and exits with a status of 1.
The program should print every possible solution to the problem:
       Each solution is printed on a separate line.
       Format: see example.
       Solutions do not need to be printed in a specific order.
You are only allowed to import the sys module.
